# Application of Deep Q-Networks on Cartpole Control Problem and Playing Atari Games
– Cartpole problem- Comparison of Q-Learning Algorithm and Deep Q-Network(DQN). Performed multiple experiments
to improve performances of both QL and DQN by changing hyperparameters.
– Playing Atari Games- Making a DQN agent learn to play video games with just the pixels and the game score
as inputs. Combination of a CNN and QL algorithm is used. Implemented preprocessing of sequence of images,
performed multiple experiments to tune hyperparameters, and faced RAM overflow issue.
